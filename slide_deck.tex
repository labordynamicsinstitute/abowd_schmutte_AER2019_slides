\frametitle{Motivation}

\begin{itemize}
	\item Traditional Statistical Disclosure Limitation (SDL) methods affect all public-use data. \\(Abowd and Schmutte 2015; Alexander et al. 2010) \vspace{.25in}
	\item Privacy risk = residual disclosure (Fellegi 1972)
    \item Now called complementary disclosure or subtraction attack \vspace{.25in}
	\item SDL Methods:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Coarsening
		\item Top-coding
		\item Item suppression (in cells, based on cell properties)
	\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
	\item Modern SDL methods. \vspace{.25in}
	\item Privacy risk = inferential disclosure (Dalenius 1977, Duncan and Lambert 1986) \vspace{.25in}
	\item SDL methods and concepts
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Input/output noise infusion
		\item Synthetic data
		\item Differential privacy (form of output noise infusion) (Dwork 2006)
	\end{itemize}

	% \item Administrative and transaction databases proliferate providing both
	% \begin{itemize}
	% 	\item more, cheaper options for producing statistics;
	% 	\item greater risk of privacy loss.

\frametitle{Histograms}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Database: an unnormalized histogram $x\in \mathbb{Z}^{\ast |\chi |}$
	\item $x_{i}$, is the count of elements in the database $D$ of type $i\in \chi $
	\item $||x||_{1}=\sum_{i=1}^{|\chi |}\left\vert x_{i}\right\vert$ .
	\item $||{x}-{y}||_{1}$: number of records that differ between ${x}$ and ${y}$
	\item $x$ and $y$ are \textit{adjacent} if $||{x}-{y}||_{1}=1$ \vspace*{.25in}
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Intuition:}
\begin{itemize}
	\item The database is a contingency table
	\item $\chi$ are cross-classifications of attributes

\frametitle{Queries}
\begin{definition}{Linear Query}
A \textit{linear query} is a mapping $f:[-1,1]^{|\chi |}\times \mathbb{Z}%
^{\ast |\chi |}\rightarrow \mathbb{Z}^{\ast }$ such that $f(m,x)=m^{T}x$
where $x\in \mathbb{Z}^{\ast |\chi |}$ and $m\in \lbrack -1,1]^{|\chi |}$.
\end{definition}

\textbf{Intuition:}
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textit{Counting query:} $m_{i}\in\{0,1\}$
	\item The number of observations that satisfy particular conditions
	\item Can be used to calculate all margins of the contingency table
	\item \textit{Normalized Counting Queries:} Normalize output by database size; (a.k.a.\ proportions, not frequencies)
\end{itemize}
% A
% \textit{counting query} is a special case in which  Counting queries return . They are the tool an
% analyst would use to calculate multidimensional margins for the contingency
% table representation of the database. A \textit{normalized linear query} is
% a mapping $f:[-1,1]^{|\chi |}\times \mathbb{Z}^{\ast |\chi |}\rightarrow
% \lbrack 0,1]$ such that if $\tilde{f}$ is a linear query then $f(m,x)=\tilde{%
% f}(m,x)/||x||_{1}$.

\frametitle{Query Release Mechanism}
\begin{definition}[Query Release Mechanism]
\label{def:query_mechanism} Let $\mathcal{F}$ be a set of normalized linear
queries with domain $[-1,1]^{|\chi |}\times \mathbb{Z}^{\ast |\chi |}$ and
range $R\subseteq \left[ 0,1\right] $, and let $k$ be the number of queries
to be answered. A query release mechanism $M$ is a random function $M:%
\mathbb{Z}^{\ast |\chi |}\times \mathcal{F}^{k}\rightarrow R^{k}$ whose
inputs are a histogram $x\in \mathbb{Z}^{\ast |\chi |}$ and a set of $k$
normalized linear queries $f=(f_{1},\ldots ,f_{k})\in \mathcal{F}^{k}$. The
probability of observing $B\subseteq R^{k}$ is $\Pr \left[ M(x,(f_{1},\ldots
,f_{k})\in B|X=x,F=f\right] $, where $\Pr \left[ z\in B|X=x,F=f\right] $ is
the conditional probability given $X=x$ and $F=f$ that the query output is
in $B\in \mathcal{B}$, where $\mathcal{B}$ are the measurable subsets of $%
R^{k}$.

\frametitle{Differential Privacy}
\begin{definition}[$(\protect\varepsilon ,\protect\delta )$-differential
privacy]
\label{def:dif_priv} A query release mechanism $M$ satisfies $(\varepsilon
,\delta )$-differential privacy if
\begin{equation*}
\sup_{x,x^{\prime }\in N_{x}}\sup_{B\in \mathcal{B}}\left\{ \frac{\Pr \left[
M(x,(f_{1},\ldots ,f_{k}))\in B\right] }{\Pr \left[ M(x^{\prime
},(f_{1},\ldots ,f_{k}))\in B\right] +\delta }\right\} \leq e^{\varepsilon },
\end{equation*}%
where $N_{x}=\left\{ (x,x^{\prime })\ s.t.~x,x^{\prime }\in \mathbb{Z}^{\ast
|\chi |}~\text{and}~||x-x^{\prime }||_{1}=1\right\} $ and $\mathcal{B}$ are
the measurable subsets of the query output space, $R^{k}$. The set $N_{x}$
contains all the \textit{adjacent histograms} of $x$.

\frametitle{Differential Privacy and Inferential Disclosure}
\begin{itemize}

\item Let $x$ and $x^{\prime }$ differ in one entry.
\item WLOG, $x$ and $x^{\prime }$ are $N$ samples from Multinomial with prob.\ $\pi $
\item By Bayes Theorem:
% \item Inferential disclosure occurs if
% $$\Pr \left[ X=x\left\vert \pi, N, F=f\right. \right]$$ and
% $\Pr \left[ X=x^{\prime}\left\vert \pi, N, F=f\right. \right]$.

\begin{equation*}
\frac{\Pr \left[ M(x,(f_{1},\ldots ,f_{k})\in B|X=x,F=f\right] }{\Pr \left[
M(x^{\prime },(f_{1},\ldots ,f_{k})\in B|X=x^{\prime },F=f\right] }=\frac{%
\frac{\Pr \left[ X=x\left\vert B,\pi ,N,F=f\right. \right] }{\Pr \left[
X=x^{\prime }\left\vert B,\pi ,N,F=f\right. \right] }}{\frac{\Pr \left[
X=x\left\vert \pi ,N,F=f\right. \right] }{\Pr \left[ X=x^{\prime }\left\vert
\pi ,N,F=f\right. \right] }},  \label{eq:posterior_odds}
\end{equation*}%
\item LHS is $(\varepsilon,0)$-differential privacy
\item RHS is the posterior odds for the confidential data after v. before release.
\item Implications
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Differential privacy bounds ability to distinguish inputs based on output
	\item No information can be released without some privacy loss [impossibility of zero inferential disclosure]

Given parameters $\varepsilon >0$, $0<\delta <1$ and $0<\beta <1$, there
exist mechanisms $M(x)$ including the PMW mechanism that can
interactively answer sequences of queries $f_{t}\in \mathcal{Q}$ for $%

Cornell National Social Survey (CNSS) from 2011, 2012,
and 2013.
\begin{itemize}
\item Income, measured in nine bins;

\item \texttt{JAq6}, \textquotedblleft In general, how would you rate your
overall health?\textquotedblright\

\item \textquotedblleft If medical information could be shared
electronically between the places where a patient receives medical care, how
do you think that would:\textquotedblright\

\begin{enumerate}
\item \texttt{JAq4@b}, \textquotedblleft \ldots affect the privacy and
security of medical information?\textquotedblright\ measured as a Likert
scale with five categories (proxy for privacy preferences, $\gamma $).

\item \texttt{JAq4@a}, \textquotedblleft \ldots affect the quality of
medical care?\textquotedblright\ measured as a Likert scale with five
categories (proxy for accuracy preferences, $\eta $).
